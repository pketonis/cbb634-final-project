# cbb634-final-project
My final project code for CBB 634.


I really enjoyed working on this project and learning how to make an interactive webserver and API endpoints. It took a lot of troubleshooting and hours of searching for the right syntax to get the job done, but it was very rewarding. I think I walked away with a new appreciation for error-handling and debugging after finishing this project.
